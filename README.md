# node-gitlab-2-github

## Install

1. You need nodejs and npm installed
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github.git`
1. `cd node-gitlab-2-github`
1. `npm i`

## Preliminaries

Before using this script, you must mirror your GitLab repo to your new GitHub repo. This can be done with the following steps:

```bash
# Clone the repo from GitLab using the `--mirror` option. This is like
# `--bare` but also copies all refs as-is. Useful for a full backup/move.
git clone --mirror git@your-gitlab-site.com:username/repo.git

# Change into newly created repo directory
cd repo

# Push to GitHub using the `--mirror` option.  The `--no-verify` option skips any hooks. 
git push --no-verify --mirror git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Set push URL to the mirror location
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

# To periodically update the repo on GitHub with what you have in GitLab
git fetch -p origin
git push --no-verify --mirror
```

After doing this, the autolinking of issues/commits will work. See **Usage** for next steps.

## Usage

The user must be a member of the project you want to copy or else you won't see it in the first step.

1. `cp sample_settings.js settings.js`
1. edit settings.js
1. run `node index.js`


## Where to find info for the `settings.js`


### gitlab

#### gitlab.url

The URL under which your gitlab instance is hosted.

#### gitlab.token

Go to your settings. Open the Access Token tab. Create a new Access Token and copy that into the `settings.js`

#### gitlab.projectID

Leave it null for the first run of the script. Then the script will show you which projects there are.

### github

#### github.baseUrl

Where is the github instance hosted? Default is the official `api.github.com` domain

#### github.owner

Under which organisation or user will the new project be hosted

#### github.username

Go to your settings. Open the Access Token tab. Create a new Access Token and copy that into the `settings.js`

#### github.token

Go to [Settings / Developer settings / Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Generate a new token and copy that into the `settings.js`

#### github.repo

What is the name of the new repo

### usermap

Maps the usernames from gitlab to github. If the assinee of the gitlab issue is equal to the one currently logged in github it will also get assigned without a usermap. The Mentions in issues will also be translated to the new github name.

### projectmap

When one renames the project while transfering so that the projects don't loose there links to the mentioned issues.


## Import limit

Because Github has a limit of 5000 Api requests per hour one has to watch out that one doesn't get over this limit. I transfered one of my project with it ~ 300 issues with ~ 200 notes. This totals to some 500 objects excluding commits which are imported through githubs importer. I never got under 3800 remaining requests (while testing it two times in one hour).

So the rule of thumb should be that one can import a repo with ~ 2500 issues without a problem.

## Bugs

the milestone refs and issue refs do not seem to be rewritten properly at the
moment. specifically, milestones show up like `%4` in comments
and issue refs like `#42` do not remap to the `#42` from gitlab under the new
issue number in github. @ references are remapped properly (yay). If this is a
deal breaker, a large amount of the code to do this has been written it just
appears to no longer work in current form :(
