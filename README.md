# node-gitlab-2-github

## Install

1. You need nodejs and npm installed
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github.git`
1. `cd node-gitlab-2-github`
1. `npm i`

## Preliminaries

Before using this script, you must mirror your GitLab repo to your new GitHub repo. This can be done with the following steps:

```bash
# Clone the repo from GitLab using the `--mirror` option. This is like
# `--bare` but also copies all refs as-is. Useful for a full backup/move.
git clone --mirror git@your-gitlab-site.com:username/repo.git

# Change into newly created repo directory
cd repo

# Push to GitHub using the `--mirror` option.  The `--no-verify` option skips any hooks.
git push --no-verify --mirror git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Set push URL to the mirror location
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

# To periodically update the repo on GitHub with what you have in GitLab
git fetch -p origin
git push --no-verify --mirror
```

After doing this, the autolinking of issues, commits, and branches will work. See **Usage** for next steps.

## Usage

The user must be a member of the project you want to copy. This user must be the one

1. `cp sample_settings.ts settings.ts`
1. edit settings.ts
1. run `npm run start`

### Docker

If you don't have Node.js installed in your local environment and don't want to install it you can use the Dockerized approach.

1. Make sure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed in your computer. You can test running `docker version` in the terminal.
1. `cp sample_settings.ts settings.ts`
1. edit settings.ts
1. `docker build -t node-gitlab-2-github:latest .`, or, you can use `make build-image`
1. `docker run node-gitlab-2-github:latest`, or, you can use `make docker-run`

If you want to let it run in the background (detached mode), just use the following command:

1. `docker run -d node-gitlab-2-github:latest`

### Docker with bind mounts

In order to optimize the usage of the dockerized application, one can use the `bind mounts` feature of Docker ([Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)). This way, whenever you change the `settings.ts` file in the host environment it will change in the container filesystem as well.

The process to use this trick is pretty much the same we presented before, the only different is the addition of a flag in the docker command to tell it what is the directory/file to be bound.

1. Make sure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed in your computer. You can test running `docker version` in the terminal.
1. `cp sample_settings.ts settings.ts`
1. edit settings.ts
1. `docker build -t node-gitlab-2-github:latest .`, or, you can use `make build-image`
1. This command must work for **Linux** or **Mac**: `docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/settings.ts",target="/app/settings.ts",readonly node-gitlab-2-github:latest`, or, you can use `make docker-run-bind`

* If you want to run this last command in the Windows environment, please consult the Docker documentation on how to solve the problem of the pwd command expanding incorrectly there - [Docker documentation - Topics for windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot/topics/#topics-for-windows).

## Where to find info for the `settings.ts`

### gitlab

#### gitlab.url

The URL under which your gitlab instance is hosted. Default is the official `http://gitlab.com` domain.

#### gitlab.token

Go to [Settings / Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens). Create a new Access Token with `api` and `read_repository` scopes and copy that into the `settings.ts`

#### gitlab.projectID

Leave it null for the first run of the script. Then the script will show you which projects there are. Can be either string or number.

#### gitlab.listArchivedProjects

When listing projects on the first run (projectID = null), include archived ones too. The default is `true`.

#### gitlab.sessionCookie

GitLab's API [does not allow downloading of attachments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24155) and only images can be downloaded using HTTP. To work around this limitation and enable binary attachments to be migrated one can use the session cookie set in the browser after logging in to the gitlab instance. The cookie is named `_gitlab_session`.

### github

#### github.baseUrl

Where is the github instance hosted? The default is the official `github.com` domain

#### github.apiUrl

Point this to the api. The default is `api.github.com`.

#### github.owner

Under which organisation or user will the new project be hosted

#### github.ownerIsOrg

A boolean indicator (default is `false`) to specify that the owner of this repo is an Organisation.

#### github.token

Go to [Settings / Developer settings / Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Generate a new token with `repo` scope and copy that into the `settings.ts`

#### github.token_owner

Set to the user name of the user whose token is used (see above). This is required to determine whether the user running the migration is also the creator of comments and issues. If this is the case and `useIssueCreationAPI` is `true` (see below), the extra line specifying who created a comment or issue will not be added.

#### github.repo

What is the name of the new repo

#### github.recreateRepo

If `true` (default is `false`), we will try to delete the destination github repository if present, and (re)create it. The github token must be granted `delete_repo` scope. The newly created repository will be made private by default.

If you've set `github.recreateRepo` to `true` and the repo belongs to an Organisation, the `github.ownerIsOrg` flag **must** be set as `true`.

This is useful when debugging this tool or a specific migration. You will always be prompted for confirmation.

### s3 (optional)

S3 can be used to store attachments from issues. If omitted, `has attachment` label will be added to GitHub issue.

#### s3.accessKeyId and s3.secretAccessKey

AWS [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) that are used to copy attachments from GitLab into the S3 bucket.

IAM User who owns these credential must have [write permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-policies-s3.html#iam-policy-ex0) to the bucket.

#### s3.bucket

Existing bucket, with an appropriate security policy. One possible policy is to allow [public access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html).

#### s3.region

Specify Region (example: us-west-1) of bucket [list of regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html)

### usermap

Maps the usernames from gitlab to github. If the assinee of the gitlab issue is equal to the one currently logged in github it will also get assigned without a usermap. The Mentions in issues will also be translated to the new github name.

### projectmap

When one renames the project while transfering so that the projects don't loose there links to the mentioned issues.

### conversion

#### conversion.useLowerCaseLabels

If this is set to `true` (default) then labels from GitLab will be converted to lowercase in GitHub.

#### conversion.addIssueInformation

If this is set to `true` (default) then issues and pull requests will get information about assignees (both), reviewers and approvers (PR only) added to their description.

### transfer

#### transfer.milestones

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will transfer milestones.

#### transfer.labels

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will transfer labels.

#### transfer.issues

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will transfer issues.

#### transfer.mergeRequests

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will transfer merge requests.

#### transfer.releases

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will transfer releases.
Note that github api for releases is limited and hence this will only transfer the title and description of the releases
and add them to github in chronological order, but it would not preserve the original release dates, nor transfer artefacts or assets.

### dryRun

As default it is set to `false`. Doesn't fire the requests to github api and only does the work on the gitlab side to test for wonky cases before using up api-calls

### exportUsers

If this is set to `true` (default is `false`) then a file called "users.txt" wil be created containing all
usernames that contributed to the repository. You can use this with dryRun when you need to map users
for the migration, but you do not know all the source usernames.

### useIssueImportAPI

Set to `true` (default) to enable using the [GitHub preview API for importing issues](https://gist.github.com/jonmagic/5282384165e0f86ef105). This allows setting the date for issues and comments instead of inserting an additional line in the body.

### usePlaceholderIssuesForMissingIssues

NOTE: This setting requires `usePlaceholderIssuesForMissingMergeRequests` to be set to `false` (default).

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will automatically create empty dummy issues for every 'missing' GitLab issue (if you deleted a GitLab issue for example). Those issues will be closed on Github and they ensure that the issue ids stay the same on both GitLab and Github.

### usePlaceholderIssuesForMissingMergeRequests

NOTE: GitLab has distinct numbers for issues and merge requests whereas GitHub treats pull requests as issues.
Only use this setting if your GitLab repository does not have issues or you do not intend on migrating them.
This setting therefore requires `usePlaceholderIssuesForMissingIssues` to be set to `false`.

If this is set to `true` then the migration process will automatically create empty dummy issues for every 'missing' GitLab merge request (if you deleted a GitLab merge request for example). Those issues will be closed on Github and they ensure that the issue ids stay the same on both GitLab and Github.

#### usePlaceholderMilestonesForMissingMilestones

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will automatically create empty dummy milestones for every 'missing' GitLab milestone (if you deleted a GitLab milestone for example). Those milestones will be closed on Github and they ensure that the milestone ids stay the same on both GitLab and Github.

#### useReplacementIssuesForCreationFails

If this is set to `true` (default) then the migration process will automatically create so called "replacement-issues" for every issue where the migration fails. This replacement issue will be exactly the same, but the original description will be lost. In the future, the description of the replacement issue will also contain a link to the original issue on GitLab. This way, users who still have access to the GitLab repository can still view its content. However, this is still an open task. (TODO)

It would of course be better to find the cause for migration fails, so that no replacement issues would be needed. Finding the cause together with a retry-mechanism would be optimal, and will maybe come in the future - currently the replacement-issue-mechanism helps to keep things in order.

### useIssuesForAllMergeRequests

If this is set to `true` (default is `false`) then all merge requests will be migrated as GitHub issues (rather than pull requests). This can be
used to sidestep the problem where pull requests are rejected by GitHub if the feature branch no longer exists or has been merged.

### filterByLabel

Filters all merge requests and issues by these labels. The applicable values can be found in the Gitlab API documentation for [issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html#list-project-issues) and [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#list-merge-requests) respectively. Default is `null` which returns all issues/merge requests.

### skipMergeRequestStates

Merge requests in GitLab with any of the states listed in this array will not be transferred to GitHub (e.g. set to `['merged', 'closed']` to avoid creating issues for closed MRs whose branches have been deleted).

### skipMatchingComments

This is an array (empty per default) that may contain string values. Any note/comment in any issue, that contains one or more of those string values, will be skipped (meaining not migrated). Note that this is case insensitive, therefore the string value `foo` would also lead to skipping notes containing a (sub)string `FOO`.

Suggested values:

- `time spent`, since those kind of terms can be used in GitLab to track time, they are rather meaningless in Github though
- action entries, such as `changed the description`, `added 1 commit`, `mentioned in merge request`, etc as they are interpreted as comments

### mergeRequests

Object consisting of `logfile` and `log`. If `log` is set to `true`, then the merge requests are logged in the specified file and not migrated. Conversely, if `log` is set to `false`, then the merge requests are migrated to GitHub and not logged. If the source or target branches linked to the merge request have been deleted, the merge request cannot be migrated to a pull request; instead, an issue with a custom "gitlab merge request" tag is created with the full comment history of the merge request.

### usermap

Maps gitlab user names to github users. This is used to properly set assignees in issues and PRs and to translate mentions in issues.

### projectmap

This is useful when migrating multiple projects if they are renamed at destination. Provide a map from gitlab names to github names so that any cross-project references (e.g. issues) are not lost.

## Import limit

Because Github has a limit of 5000 Api requests per hour one has to be careful not to go over this limit. I transferred one of my project with it ~ 300 issues with ~ 200 notes. This totals to some 500 objects excluding commits which are imported through githubs importer. I never got under 3800 remaining requests (while testing it two times in one hour).

So the rule of thumb should be that one can import a repo with ~ 2500 issues without a problem.

## Bugs

### Issue migration fail

See section 'useReplacementIssuesForCreationFails' above for more infos!
One reason seems to be some error with `Octokit` (error message snippet: https://pastebin.com/3VNUNYLh)

### Milestone, MR and issue references

This is WIP

the milestone refs and issue refs do not seem to be rewritten properly at the
moment. specifically, milestones show up like `%4` in comments
and issue refs like `#42` do not remap to the `#42` from gitlab under the new
issue number in github. @ references are remapped properly (yay). If this is a
deal breaker, a large amount of the code to do this has been written it just
appears to no longer work in current form :(

## Feature suggestions / ideas

### Throttling mechanism

A throttling mechanism could maybe help to avoid api rate limit errors.
In some scenarios the ability to migrate is probably more important than the total
duration of the migration process. Some users may even be willing to accept a very long duration (> 1 day if necessary?), if they can get the migration done at all, in return.

### Make requests run in parallel

Some requests could be run in parallel, to shorten the total duration. Currently all GitLab- and Github-Api-Requests are run sequentially.
